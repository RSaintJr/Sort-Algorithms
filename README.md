# Sort-Algorithms
Checking the sorting methods, their execution time, number of exchanges and comparisons.

The sorting methods were tested based on the following criteria:

Execution Time: The time taken to sort the data.

Number of Exchanges: The number of times the algorithm had to swap elements in order to sort the data. This was tracked by incrementing a counter each time a swap operation was performed.

Number of Comparisons: The number of times the algorithm had to compare elements in order to sort the data. This was tracked by incrementing a counter each time a comparison operation was performed.
