# Sort-Algorithms
Checking the sorting methods, their execution time, number of exchanges and comparisons.

The sorting methods were tested based on the following criteria:

 1 - Execution Time: The time taken to sort the data.

 2 - Number of Exchanges: The number of times the algorithm had to swap elements in order to sort the data. This was tracked by incrementing a counter each time a swap operation was       performed.

 3 - Number of Comparisons: The number of times the algorithm had to compare elements in order to sort the data. This was tracked by incrementing a counter each time a comparison          operation was performed.
